# Prometheus

In ancient Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan revered for his cunning and foresight. Defying the Olympian gods, he bestowed upon humanity a gift of immeasurable value – fire. This was not just literal fire, but a symbol of technology, knowledge, and the spark of civilization itself. Prometheus, whose name means 'forethought', was celebrated as a champion of mankind, empowering them with the tools for progress and enlightenment, much to the chagrin of Zeus and the other gods who wished to keep humans in a state of dependency and ignorance.

## Enlightenment Through Education

Mirroring this legendary benefactor, the Prometheus app emerges as a beacon of hope and empowerment within the confinements of prison walls. It offers inmates a transformative tool – a comprehensive platform providing access to educational resources, degree plans, course schedules, and more. By equipping inmates with technology and knowledge, Prometheus paves a path for their reentry into society. Like the mythical fire, it ignites a new beginning, fostering personal growth, intellectual development, and the promise of a brighter, reformed future. This digital mentor opens doors to a world beyond bars, offering a chance for redemption and the rebuilding of lives through the power of education.
